mineball logo assets

Files created:
- assets/mineball_icon.svg — primary symbol (vector)
- assets/mineball_icon_circle.svg — circular PFP variant (vector)
- assets/mineball_wordmark.svg — symbol + blocky wordmark (vector)

Usage notes:
- All assets are SVG (scalable). Use directly for tokens, profile pics, and posters.
- For small icons (16–48px) prefer `mineball_icon_circle.svg` or the simplified core square from the icon.
- Colors used: stone gray (#7d7d7d), dirt brown (#7a5230), emerald accent (#0dbf7a), diamond blue accent (#2aa7ff).
- You can export PNG at desired sizes from the SVGs (e.g., 64×64, 128×128, 512×512).

If you want, I can:
- Export PNG/ICO variants at standard sizes.
- Produce a set of color-reversed (light) variants for light backgrounds.
- Create an animated token spin GIF (subtle rotation).
