# mineball Narrative

## What is mineball?

mineball is a **mining-inspired flywheel meme coin** on Solana. It's an experiment in self-reinforcing tokenomics where every transaction fuels a compounding cycle of rewards, buybacks, and liquidity growth.

## The Mining Metaphor

Think of a sandbox game where you mine blocks:
- **Blocks are mined** → Every transaction is mining activity
- **Resources accumulate** → Fees flow into protocol pools
- **Value compounds** → When pools reach thresholds, the flywheel activates
- **The system grows block by block** → Each mining cycle strengthens the ecosystem

## The Flywheel Mechanics

mineball uses classic "ball" mechanics — a snowball that grows as it rolls:

1. **Volume = Mining Activity**
   - Each transaction applies a small tax (e.g., 6%)
   - This tax is the "mined resource"

2. **Resources Accumulate**
   - Tax is split into pools:
     - Mining rewards (holder rewards)
     - Buyback fund
     - Liquidity reinforcement
     - Optional burn

3. **Automatic Triggers**
   - When a pool reaches its threshold:
     - **Rewards distribute** to holders
     - **Buybacks execute** using accumulated funds
     - **Liquidity grows** automatically
   - A "mining cycle" completes

4. **Compounding Growth**
   - More volume → More fees → Larger pools
   - Larger pools → More rewards + buybacks + liquidity
   - More rewards + liquidity → More holders + trading
   - More trading → More volume
   - **The mineball grows block by block**

## What mineball IS

✅ A meme experiment inspired by sandbox mining games  
✅ A deterministic, on-chain flywheel system  
✅ A transparent redistribution mechanism  
✅ An automated tokenomics model  
✅ A narrative about compounding and progression  

## What mineball is NOT

❌ Not financial advice  
❌ Not an investment product  
❌ Not using copyrighted game assets  
❌ Not promising profits  
❌ Not controlled by manual intervention after deployment  

## Philosophy

mineball embodies simplicity:
- **Fixed rules**: No changes after deployment
- **No backdoors**: No mint authority, no freezing, no blacklists
- **Transparent**: All logic on-chain, all events visible
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs always produce same outputs
- **Self-sustaining**: No manual intervention needed

## The Experiment

Can a simple flywheel create a self-sustaining economy?  
Can mining-inspired narratives resonate with meme traders?  
Can deterministic rules build trust in a meme coin?

**mineball is the experiment.**

Mine. Accumulate. Compound. Grow.
